# 0x1C C - Makefiles :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers makefiles

At the end of this project, I was able to understand:
  
* What are make, Makefiles
* When, why and how to use Makefiles
* What are rules and how to set and use them
* What are explicit and implicit rules
* What are the most common / useful rules
* What are variables and how to set and use them

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Create your first Makefile.
1. make -f 1-Makefile
2. Create your first useful Makefile.
3. make -f 3-Makefile
4. A complete Makefile
5. Create a function island_perimeter(grid): that returns the perimeter of the island described in grid (Task in progress)
6. make -f 100-Makefile
