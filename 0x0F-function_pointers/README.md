# 0x0F Function pointers :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the use of functions pointers

At the end of this project, I reached my goal to understand:
  
* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that prints a name.
1. Function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
2. Function that searches for an integer.
3. Program that performs simple operations.
4. Program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
