# 0x0E C - Structures, typedef :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concept of structures and how define them 

  At the end of this project, I reached my goal to understand:
  
* What are structures, when, why and how to use them
* How to use typedef

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Define a new type struct dog
1. Function that initialize a variable of type struct dog
2. Function that prints a struct dog
3. Define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog.
4. Function that creates a new dog.
5. Function that frees dogs
