# 0x08 C - Recursion :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the great topic of recursion; challenging but one of my favorites

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is recursion
* How to implement recursion
* In what situations you should implement recursion
* In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that prints a string.
1. Function that prints a string in reverse.
2. Function that returns the length of a string.
3. Function that returns the factorial of a given number.
4. Function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
5. Function that returns the natural square root of a number.
6. Function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
7. Function that returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.
8. Function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0
