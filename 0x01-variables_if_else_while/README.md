# 0x01 Variables, if, else, while :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This is the first step for learning this awesome language

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
* What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
* What the the relational operators and how to use them
* What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
* How to use the if, if ... else statements
* How to use comments
* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
* How to assign values to variables
* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
* How to use the while loop
* How to use variables with the while loop
* How to print variables using printf
* What is the ASCII character set
* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Program that will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed
1. Program print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n
2. Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase
3. Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase
4. Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase
5. Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0
6. Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0
7. Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse
8. Program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase
9. Program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
10. Program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99
11. Program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
12. Program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits
13. Program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers
