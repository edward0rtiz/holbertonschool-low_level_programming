# 0x00 C - Hello, World :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This is the first step for learning this awesome language

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* Why C programming is awesome (donâ€™t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
* Who invented C
* Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
* What happens when you type gcc main.c
* What is an entry point
* What is main
* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
* How to compile using gcc
* What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
* What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
* How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function
* How does the main function influence the return value of the program 
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Script that runs a C file through the preprocessor
1. Script that compiles a C file
2. Script that generates the assembly code of a C code
3. Script that compiles a C file and creates an executable
4. C program that prints a quote
6. C program that prints a quote v2
7. Script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code
8. C program that prints ea quote followed by a new line, to the standard error
