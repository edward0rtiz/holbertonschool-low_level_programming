# 0x0A C - argc, argv :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concept argc and argv

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Program that prints its name
1. Program that prints the number of arguments passed into it
2. Program that prints all arguments it receives.
3. Program that multiplies two numbers.
4. Program that adds positive numbers.
5. Program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
