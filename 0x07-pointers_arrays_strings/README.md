# 0x07 C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This project covers third part of pointers, arrays and strings concepts

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that fills memory with a constant byte.
1. Function that copies memory area.
2. Function that locates a character in a string.
3. Function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
4. Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
5. Function that locates a substring.
6. Function that prints the chessboard. (7-print_chessboard)
7. Function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
8. Function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
9. Create a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
