# 0x14 C - Bit manipulation :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers bit manipulation

At the end of this project, I was able to solve this questions:
  
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
1. Function that prints the binary representation of a number.
2. Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3. Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4. Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. Function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
6. Function that checks the endianness.
7. Find the password for this program.
