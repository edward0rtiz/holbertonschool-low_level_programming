# 0x03 Debugging :pencil2:

> Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually. This project covers the optimal framwork and blueprint for debugging a script

## Learning Objectives :bookmark_tabs:

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is debugging
* What are some methods of debugging manually
* How to read the error messages
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. File must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
1. Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers
3. Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years
