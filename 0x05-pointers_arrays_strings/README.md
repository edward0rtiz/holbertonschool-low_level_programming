# 0x05 C - Pointers, arrays and strings :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers pointer, arrays and strings concepts

  At the end of this project, I am able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What are pointers and how to use them
* What are arrays and how to use them
* What are the differences between pointers and arrays
* How to use strings and how to manipulate them
* Scope of variables
  
## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98
1. Function that swaps the values of two integers.
2. Function that returns the length of a string.
3. Function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.
4. Function that prints a string, in reverse.
5. Function that reverses a string.
6. Function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character.
7. Function that prints half of a string.
8. Function that prints n elements of an array of integers.
9. Function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest.
10. Function that convert a string to an integer.
11. Program that generates random valid passwords for the program 101-crackme.
