# 0x10 C - Variadic functions :pencil2:

> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the use of functions pointers

At the end of this project, I was able to solve this questions:
  
* What are variadic functions
* How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
* Why and how to use the const type qualifier

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
1. Function that prints numbers.
2. Function that prints strings.
3. Function that prints anything.
4. 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton.
